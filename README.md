- **Requirements**: Any web server capable of serving HTML/CSS/JS files
- **Hosting Options**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting service
- **No Build Process**: Direct deployment of source files
- **No Database**: No persistent storage requirements

## Technical Notes
- The application uses modern CSS features like custom properties and flexbox/grid
- Responsive design considerations for mobile compatibility
- Heavy use of CSS animations and transitions for enhanced UX
- Modular CSS structure with clearly defined color schemes and component styles
